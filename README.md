# Da Vinci 2

Last year in 2022, I had learnt full stack web development using the MERN stack. I created this project to practise my skills. Da Vinci 2 is a platform where users can create AI generated images using OpenAI's Dall-E 2 and share them with the community. 

# Key Features

- AI-Driven Image Generation: Backend was integrated together with the OpenAI API to do so.
- MERN Stack Development: Created a custom REST API and client-side server using express and node.js. MongoDB was used for the data storage and React was used for building a dynamic and responsive front end.
- Cloudinary Integration: All user-generated images are stored on Cloudinary: a cloud-based service.
- Tailwind CSS Styling: The web application was styled using Tailwind to create a sleek and minimalistic user interface.


# Usage

To get this project up and running, you'll need to have Node.js, npm and MongoDB installed on your computer. Then, from your command line:

- https://github.com/tanveersingh10/davinci_2

- cd davinci2

- cd client 
- npm install
- npm run dev

- cd ../server
- npm install
- npm start
